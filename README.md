Tweet #tag funtion
==================

**Guide!**  
Start writing your `hastag` , and when you type the # character, a dropdown will open with all the existing tweets, and the more you write, the more precise the auto-suggestion becomes. As soon as you find your tweet, click on it and it will be included. The new hastags are grey while the existing ones are blue.
